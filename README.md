**BLE-based Distance Estimation System**
This assignment is a team-based IoT project that aims to design and implement a BLE-based distance estimation system using ESP32 devices, where students measure RSSI and txPower values to estimate the distance between devices via a path-loss model, display the results in real time, analyze the accuracy through experiments at various distances, and present findings with tables, charts, and documented observations.
